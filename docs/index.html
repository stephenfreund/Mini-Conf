<h1>Fake Homepage</h1>
<p>We are delighted to announce that early registration for PLDI 2021 is now open, and we’re excited to give you a quick overview of our program and plans for this second virtual PLDI.</p>
<p><a type="button" class="btn btn-primary bt-margin mr-2" href="https://regmaster.com/2021conf/PLDI21/register.php">Register</a> <a type="button" class="btn btn-success br-margin" href="https://www.pldi21.org">PLDI 2021 Virtual Site</a></p>
<h2 id="pldi-2021-at-a-glance">PLDI 2021 at a Glance</h2>
<p><strong>Around June 18.</strong> PLDI will begin a day or two before the first scheduled events, when we open our website for you to access pre-recorded talks from the authors of the PLDI technical papers. View as many as you like, throw watch parties for colleagues, students, and friends, and enjoy this preview of PLDI’s technical program.</p>
<p><strong>June 20-22.</strong> PLDI’s scheduled events start with three days of tutorials, workshops, and other co-located events, including HOPL IV on June 20-22. Your registration for PLDI gives you full access to all colocated events. We will make recordings of those events available to all attendees as soon as the events are over in case you are unable to participate at their scheduled times.</p>
<p><strong>June 23-25.</strong> We will hold the main PLDI conference on June 23-25, from roughly 9am to 3pm EDT, about the time we would have been meeting in person in Quebec City. The program includes technical talks and poster sessions, invited talks, and various other opportunities to exchange technical ideas and socialize with colleagues. Each day’s events will be mirrored 12 hours later so that you can attend PLDI at a time compatible with your schedule and timezone. The main and mirrored events may not be 100% identical, but we aim to provide similar opportunities to engage with the PLDI community in each.</p>
<h2 id="the-pldi-technical-program">The PLDI Technical Program</h2>
<p>The PLDI technical program centers around two paper sessions on each day of the main conference. Those technical sessions will be structured as</p>
<p>two parallel half-hour tracks of pre-recorded 5 minute talks (with no Q&amp;A) to serve as a sampler/refresher of the papers featured in the session; and a subsequent one-hour poster session for Q&amp;A and in-depth discussion with the authors.</p>
<p>The poster components will be held in our Gather Town Conference Center, a virtual space in which your avatar can visit posters, ask authors questions, bump into old friends (or new!), and chat with other attendees, all over video.</p>
<p>In addition to technical sessions, the PLDI schedule will include events such as invited talks from XXXX; scheduled social events ranging from XXX to XXX; the Student Research Competition; events held with our industrial partners; and ample time to enjoy socializing in Gather Town.</p>
<p>Twelve hours later, we’ll do it all again. We’ll replay the invited talks and technical talks, and we’ll hold the poster sessions a second time, providing another opportunity to enjoy post-talk discussions with the authors and other attendees in case you could not attend the first poster session. We’re planning a number of additional discussions and events in the mirrored version as well.</p>
<h2 id="see-you-in-june">See You in June!</h2>
<p>Organizing a virtual conference poses a number of distinct challenges. Of particular note, participants may be attending from any timezone and with varying connectivity, and they are likely to find the highly-valued interactions with colleagues at physical conferences difficult to replicate in a virtual setting.</p>
<p>With those challenges in mind, we designed our virtual platform, program, and mirroring strategy to provide both broad access and many chances to socialize. Further, recorded lectures, live streams, chat, and Gather support complementary ways to participate and interact. We hope PLDI gives you ample opportunity to engage with the entire PLDI community, and we look forward to seeing you in June.</p>
