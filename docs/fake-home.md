<!-- <a type="button" class="btn btn-success br-margin" href="https://www.pldi21.org">PLDI 2021 Virtual Site</a> -->

We are delighted to announce that **registration for PLDI 2021 is open**.  The deadline for early registration is May 31.

PLDI is a premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.  We're excited to give you a quick overview of our program and plans for this *second* virtual PLDI.  We hope to see you all there.

### PLDI 2021 at a Glance

PLDI will begin a day or two before the first scheduled events, when we open our website for you to access pre-recorded talks from the authors of the PLDI technical papers.  View as many as you like, throw watch parties for colleagues, students, and friends, and enjoy this preview of PLDI's technical program.  

#### June 20-22: Colocated Events  

PLDI's scheduled events start with three days of tutorials, workshops, and other co-located events, including HOPL IV on June 20-22.  Registering for PLDI gives you full access to all colocated events.  We will make recordings of those events available to all attendees as soon as the events are over in case you are unable to participate at their scheduled times.

#### June 23-25: PLDI Technical Program

We will hold the main PLDI conference on June 23-25.  Each day will happen twice, first from roughly 9am to 3pm EDT and then again twelve hours later, so that you can attend at times compatible with your schedule and timezone.  The program centers around paper sessions structured as

* parallel approximately half-hour tracks of pre-recorded 5 minute talks (with no Q&A) to serve as a sampler/refresher of the papers featured in the session, which is followed by
* a poster session for Q&A and in-depth discussion with the authors.

We'll hold the poster components in Gather.town, a virtual space in which your avatar can visit posters, ask authors questions, bump into old friends (or new!), and chat with other attendees, all over video.  In addition to the paper sessions, the PLDI schedule includes invited talks; AMAs; the Student Research Competition; events held with our industrial partners; and ample time to enjoy socializing in Gather.  

Twelve hours later, we'll do it all again.  We'll replay the talks, and we'll hold the poster sessions a second time, providing another opportunity to enjoy post-talk discussions with the authors and other attendees.  The mirror event may not be 100% identical to the first, but we aim to provide similar opportunities to engage with the PLDI community in each.

### See You in June!

Organizing a virtual conference poses a number of distinct challenges.  Of particular note, participants may be attending from any timezone and with varying connectivity, they are undoubtedly balancing conference attendance with personal obligations and the rest of their lives; and they are likely to find the highly-valued interactions with colleagues at physical conferences difficult to replicate in a virtual setting.  With those challenges in mind, we designed our virtual platform and program to provide both broad access and many opportunities to attend.  Further, recorded lectures, live streams, chat, and Gather all provide complementary ways to participate and interact.  We hope PLDI gives you all a venue to learn new ideas, meet new people, and engage with the entire PLDI community.  We look forward to seeing you in June!
