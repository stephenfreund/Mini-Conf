    Thank you again for sponsorship, which is vital to the
    success of our conferences.  In addition to a page
    listing all of our sponsors, we are creating a separate
    page for each sponsor and invite you to submit content
    for that page.  This page illustrates what it will roughly
    look like.

    We hope you will be able to send us some or all of the
    following: 1) a blurb about your company and work; 2) a
    short embedded YouTube or mp4 video; 3) links to
    external pages and documents; and 4) contact information
    you'd like to share with attendees.  These pages will be
    visible to all attendees throughout the conference.

    Depending on your sponsorship level, your page may also
    include a link to a dedicated Slack channel, a Zoom
    meeting link, and a schedule of events you plan to hold
    during the week.  Details for these items are included
    in our accompanying email.

    Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
