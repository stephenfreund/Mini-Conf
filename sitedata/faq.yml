      - Question: How do I navigate the website?
        gettingStarted: True
        Answer: | 
          Use the [Schedule](schedule.html) for an overview of the week, as well as a detailed list of all events that will take place.
          All [PLDI papers](papers.html) have a pre-recorded five-minute talks, and some have longer talks.  
          The short talks will be showed during our technical sessions, and the authors will take part in poster sessions following their talk.  
          Each paper also has a Slack channel for chatting with the authors. 

          You can also find information on [Featured](plenary.html) events, including [keynotes](plenary.html#tab-invited), [AMAs](plenary.html#tab-amas), and
          the [Student Research Competition](plenary.html#tab-src).  The [Community](socials.html) page lists a number of other opportunities to 
          engage with other conference attendees.

          All [colocated events, workshops, and tutorials](workshops.html) are included with conference registration.  Each has its own page with a livestream and schedule of events.            Recordings of those events will be available to all attendees in case you are unable to attend during their scheduled times.

          Finally, don't forget to check out our [sponsors](sponsors.html) and chat with them throughout the week.

      - Question: What are the systems requirements for PLDI's services?
        gettingStarted: True
        Answer: |
          We suggest using the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, or Brave as the browser for all conference-related activities.  We have tested our site and streaming services with them, and they are supported by both [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/115002037526-Minimum-requirements-for-using-Slack) and [Gather](https://support.gather.town/help/system-specifications).            Other browsers may work, but we and our service providers may not be able to support them to the same degree. 

          The external tools used on this site, including Slack, Zoom, and Gather can all be run in the browser, so you do not need to download any additional software.  If you do use the desktop or mobile applications for any of these tools, you should also upgrade to the most recent versions.          

          A laptop or desktop computer is recommended for Gather.

      - Question: "Is PLDI accessible from my location?"
        Answer: |
          We have verified the accessibility of our services, including Zoom, Slideslive, Slack, Gather and the website from many parts of the Earth. However,
          as we are too well aware, the service status in each country may change overnight. If you have having difficulty accessing any of these services, please report it to us at on the [#helpdesk](https://pldi21.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=helpdesk) Slack channel, or [send email](https://pldi21.sigplan.org/contact) if you cannot access Slack.  


      - Question: "How does the website know my timezone?"
        Answer: >
          We use the time zone given by your browser and automatically set the schedule to this timezone. You can change the timezone on the [homepage](home.html)
          if it is not correct for your location.  If you set you timezone yourself, we recommend picking a timezone based off a nearby city to
          fully account for the various [complexities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone) surrounding them.

      - Question: What parts of PLDI are live?
        Answer: |
          The Q&A with Invited Speakers, the SRC finalist talks, and the Business Meeting, will take place live once, and then be replayed in the mirrored time slots twelve hours later.  All Q&A with AMA Speakers will be live, including those in the mirrored time slots.  These live sessions occur at specific times, so make sure to consult the [Schedule](/schedule.html).

          All colocated conferences, workshops, and tutorials are live.  Please see their specific schedules
          on how to participate in them. 
          We will make the video for these events available as soon as possible for those who cannot attended at their schedule times.

          The [Community](/socials.html) page lists other opportunities for live interaction with other attendees.


      - Question: How do I talk to the author of a paper?
        Answer: >
          All PLDI papers have a poster in Gather, and you can speak with authors using audio and video during the poster sessions featuring their work. 
          Outside of those times, you can ask questions and discuss with paper authors over Slack using the channel for their paper
          or by messaging the authors directly. 

      - Question: How can I find other people to chat with during the conference?
        Answer: "We offer a number of ways to meet and engage with others, including in Slack, in Gather, at [PL Tea](/socials.html#pltea), and through the [#mentoring](https://pldi21.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=mentoring) Slack channel."

      - Question: How do I use Zoom in the browser instead of the app?
        Answer: >
          Zoom is used for some video sessions, which you can watch using the Zoom app or within the browser. Clicking on a Zoom link will ask you to open the video in the Zoom app. If you want to use Zoom in the browser, cancel that request and click the "Join from Your Browser" link.

      - Question: How do I use Slack in the browser instead of the app?
        Answer: >

        Answer: "Each paper has a page of its own. You can find your pre-recorded talk on your paper's page. You can search for your paper by its title/author in the [Papers](/papers.html) section to get to your paper's page."

  - Section: Accessibility and Safety
    QA:
      - Question: How do you ensure safe online engagement?
        Answer: "All participants are bound and expected to uphold the conference’s [Code of Conduct](/about.html#tab-code-of-conduct). We have 
        taken several steps to safeguard against Zoom bombing by changing the permissions and 
        types of calls we use, and having moderators with the ability to evict participants, 
        amongst others. For text chat, we ask all authors, attendees, and organizers 
        to ensure meaningful conversation and take steps if inappropriate conduct occurs.
        Individual chat entries can be reported directly to the moderators as well."

      - Question: "What rules are the rules around social media?"
        Answer: >
          Please be respectful in your use of social media. Do not post messages that appear 
          as if you are representing the conference. Do not share items attendees would consider private
          under our Code of Conduct or internal links on social media to 
          prevent Zoom bombing and other forms of disruption by those not registered for the conference.

      - Question: "What happens to the recorded talks and QA sessions after the conference?"
        Answer: >
          Recordings of the talks, and also Q&A sessions for invited and other select speakers,
          will be made publicly viewable via Slideslive and the PLDI 2021 website.

      - Question:  "How is data protected?"
        Answer: >
          This site records a very limited amount of data. Data as text in Slack is accessible only to registered conference attendees and 
          will be removed within two weeks after the conference. Gather interaction will not be recorded.  Only the Zoom sessions producing the
          video streams for PLDI and colocated events will be recorded.  Zoom sessions for social events, CARES, etc. will not be recorded.
          All data from live Q&A and discussions will be destroyed after the conference, except for the Q&A sessions for invited and other select speakers.
          Videos are hosted by our 
          video partner SlidesLive.

          >

  **Privacy:** For privacy reasons, recording, screen capturing, and retransmission of video streams from the conference platform is not allowed. Textual communications on conference-provided channels are also private.

  **Names:** Attendees must use their professional names and affiliations for registration and all conference activities. Special circumstances may be discussed with the general chair.

  **Anti-harassment and Non-discrimination:** The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of SIGPLAN; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. SIGPLAN is dedicated to providing a harassment- and discrimination-free conference. In particular, attendees and organizers must abide by the ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment. We expect all the participants to use welcoming and inclusive language, to be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, to gracefully accept constructive criticism, to focus on what is best for the community, and to show empathy towards other community members. There is no tolerance for unwelcome, hostile, or disruptive behavior or speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation at the conference and all associated events. Conference participants violating these standards may be expelled from this and future conferences.

  **Getting Help:** If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, here are steps you can take:
