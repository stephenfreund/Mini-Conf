  Developers harness the power of the cloud to build innovative applications,
  websites, and businesses.  Using proof-generating automated reasoning
  techniques, AWS enables customers to answer questions about security,
  availability, durability, and functional correctness.  We call this provable
  security, absolute assurance in security of both cloud technology and of
  technology that uses the cloud.
  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/">https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/</a>

  We do proof at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from high-level
  abstractions of highly distributed and concurrent protocols, covering manual
  and automated abstractions; software implementations in high-level
  implementation languages including Java and Rust; refining down to low-level
  implementations of x86/ARM hypervisor technology. We are looking for genuine PL-enthusiasts who appreciate the power of
  automated reasoning about program behavior to bring scale into software
  development and deliver profound impact with best-of-class tooling for the
  analysis of software that covers an exceptionally broad range of
  applications that are really fun!
