## Welcome to PLDI 2021!

We hope you will enjoy the many activities happening this week.  **Please follow the Getting Started instructions above to ensure you are able to participate in all of them.**

You can navigate to everything the week has to offer through the top menu bar.  We recommend beginning with the [Schedule](calendar.html) for an overview of the week.

**PLDI Technical Conference.** The main PLDI conference will occur June 23-25 and features three invited keynotes, over eighty technical paper talks, poster sessions, and AMAs.  See the [Featured](featured.html) and [Papers](papers.html) pages for details.  The [Papers](papers.html) page offers a variety of ways to browse the PLDI papers. Each paper has its own page, featuring one or more video presentations, and a Slack channel to directly engage
with the authors.  

The PLDI technical papers sessions consist of parallel tracks of five-minute talks shown on video streams [PLDI-A](http://localhost:5000/track_pldi-A.html) and [PLDI-B](http://localhost:5000/track_pldi-B.html), followed
by a poster session in Gather for Q&A and in-depth discussion with the authors from all the papers in the session.  Each paper's page includes the times that it will be featured in technical session video streams and poster sessions.  All other PLDI technical events will be streamed to [PLDI-A](http://localhost:5000/track_pldi-A.html).

PLDI's days will be mirrored twelve hours after their first occurence.  Weâ€™ll replay the talks and hold the poster sessions for a second time, providing another opportunity to enjoy post-talk discussions with the authors and other attendees. Some events, such as the AMAs, will be held live during the mirrored days.

**Colocated Events.** A variety of other conferences, workshops, and
tutorials will take place June 20-22.  Our [Colocated](colocated.html) events
page provides the full details for each event, including its video stream, dedicated Slack channel, schedule, and any pre-recorded content.

**Community.** The week will also feature a number of [Community](socials.html)
activities, including moderated, small-group discussions in [PL Tea](/socials.html#pltea), a self-serve [mentoring channel](https://pldi21.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=mentoring)
for matching mentors and mentees during the
conference, a CARES-led discussion on [inclusivity](/socials.html#cares), various other social events. 
Our Gather virtual conference center will open 24 hours a day for meetups and socializing.

**Sponsors.** Finally, make sure to visit the [Sponsors](sponsors.html) section for information
about our sponsors. 

**Engagement.**  We have designed our virtual platform and program to provide many different types of opportunities for participation, be it attending events in our live streams, or replaying them afterwards, chatting asynchronously in Slack, or attending poster sessions and meeting others in Gather.   Best wishes for a week of learning new ideas, connecting with old colleagues and new, and engaging with the entire PLDI community.
